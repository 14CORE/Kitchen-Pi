# Kitchen-Pi
A kitchen informational display using Raspberry Pi

This is my buidl of a Raspberry Pi Kitchen interface for displaying information, home automation and more.

For now there is a web page which was originally found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5OF6tn-Ccg&index=2&list=FLTo55-kBvyy5Y1X_DTgrTOQ&ab_channel=RiquezJP

You can find the original documentation in the Web Page folder. Just edit the files to suit your needs.

This is what the web page looks like
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MKme/Kitchen-Pi/blob/master/Images/MKME.org%20Web%20Page%20.PNG" width="700"/>
</p>

The web page will cycle between YouTube live feeds, display weather and news as well as the colors will
change by the time of day.

I take no credit for the original page code and is linked in the documentation folder
