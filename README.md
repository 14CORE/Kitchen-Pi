# Kitchen-Pi
A kitchen informational display using Raspberry Pi

This is my build of a Raspberry Pi Kitchen interface for displaying information, home automation and more.

The code for the page was originally found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5OF6tn-Ccg&index=2&list=FLTo55-kBvyy5Y1X_DTgrTOQ&ab_channel=RiquezJP

Thanks to RiquezJP for getting this started for the world! I take no credit for the original page code and is linked in the documentation folder

You can find the original documentation in the Web Page folder. Just edit the files to suit your needs.

The full tutorial can be found on blog.mkme.org

This is what the web page looks like

The web page will cycle between YouTube live feeds, display weather and news as well as the colors will
change by the time of day.

Upcoming modifications will be to include local weather radar and Twitter feeds.
